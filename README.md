# Deadman Survival

- Zombie survival game
  - Health, hunger, infection, cold meters?
- Spawn in on a big abandoned military island in the arctic with military bases which you must loot for weapons
- Goal is to survive as long as possible as the zombies get stronger and stronger
  - When you first start playing you should lose quickly because you don't know what
	you're doing; part of the fun should be gaining the skill needed to survive the
	first night and so on, it shouldn't be immediately easy. The zombies' difficulties
	ramping up over time should challenge intermediate players who already are
	comfortable in the early game, not the beginner players who don't know what
	they're doing.
- You can craft but you can't build, so you gotta constantly be on foot

and it has dog ahh graphics and booba and the game gets a cult following then we win,
like make a really messy but playable gaem then clean it up

Stuff to add BEFORE a map:
- Zombie spawning
- Zombie AI
- Gunplay (shooting, reloading, defeating zombies)
- Inventory and items (picking up from the ground, holding, dropping; ammo is pulled from the inventory)
  - I don't think we need chests; Base building is not a thing and looting can just be from items placed in the world
- Player health
